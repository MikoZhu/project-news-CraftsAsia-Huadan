# News Site

This project aims to design a responsive magazine using Flexbox, Grid, and Media Querry.

The site was designed through Figma.

The site contains a header with the site's name, a logo, a navbar, also contains a big news section, and a grid of cards with other info.

## The problem
The main problems I approached are the responsive design and magazine/news webpage design. I debugged by seraching for Stackover Flow and masterial on W3C school. I am not a designer. When I don't know how to design a web page, I draw the layout and framework of the page on paper firstly and then design the draft in figma. 

I am going to add a contact form in the footer part, a sticky position in the header section and a dropdown box for the navbar in the responsive design if I have more time.
